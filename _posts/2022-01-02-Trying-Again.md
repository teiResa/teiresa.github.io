================

I'm divided. I have so much studing and work on my plate already, but I also really want to figure this Jekyll stuff out. I cannot decide whether to just transfer all of my stuff from my old site here, or continue using that one for
the next bit.

Currently, I am getting the hang of bootstrap. I finally got around to giving it a go. I must say, I could almost regret not commiting to learning it years ago. I love how much quicker everything is. The same thing happened with JS, Flexbox, and Grid. I just need to commit a few days to Jekyll once I have access to Google again.

2022.
Now that it is 2022, I have decided this year I'll try to commit daily. That sounds like far too much of a commitment. I was actually thinking to commit to 5 days of commits a week, since for 2021 averaged 2 or 3 days of commits a week.
The blogging will would help with this. Unfortionately, I don't exclusively use Github for my coding needs. My courses have proprietary text editors, Arduino uses the IDE, and I don't actually code every day. Somedays I just study, some days I have tests, some days I spend far too long reading about topics. Besides code, I also really enjoy studying the related topics around UX/UI, I'm currently in a bootcamp, and I am still working my way through The Art of Electronics.
