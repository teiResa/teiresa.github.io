I am in the process of converting my old site, while still studying and working on new content. 
For the time being, feel free to check out the menu above. 
In all honesty, I have plenty to finish up on, but for now I have been focusing on updating
current projects, creating example pages, and setting everything up so the process of moving out of my old site
will be much less painful.

To see the old site:   Notebooks > WebDev

I am quite proud of the Sketchbook. Take a gander.
