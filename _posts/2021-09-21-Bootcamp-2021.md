title: BRB, gotta study.

I'm currently enrolled in a Bootcamp and a UX course. I've decided to take minute to really concentrate on them, so
moving into this site will be a little less painful. I may end up just dropping the Jekyll schtick.


Feel free to watch my progress. I'll try to update a few times a week. This is [the collection page](https://teiresa.github.io/rwd/) for my notes and assignments.
