I found this answer when Github wouldn't allow formatting. It works at the time of writing this post.

Originally I tried just using HTML's &nbsp; and &#32; repetitively-- equivalent to a series of spaces, to no prevail. Since my keyboards don't have a numpad, I had to find an alternative to using Alt+32. Enter Unicode.  I didn't even try 
U+0020
